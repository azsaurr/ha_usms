# USMS Smart Meter Custom Integration for Home Assistant

[USMS](https://www.usms.com.bn/smartmeter/about.html) is a digital platform for electric and water meters in Brunei. This integration allows Home Assistant to poll data from your USMS account.

Getting started is as easy as providing your login information (username and password), and Home Assistant will handle the rest. After configuration, every meter under the account will be made available in Home Assistant, alongside the following values as extra attributes:

- `Credit` - remaining balance/credit
- `Unit` - remaining unit, also the default state of the entity
- `Last update` - timestamp of last update by USMS
- `Last refresh` - timestamp of last refresh attempt by the integration
- `Currency` - currency in BND (Brunei Dollars)
- `Last month consumption` - the total consumption of this meter last month
- `Last month cost` - the cost for the total consumption of this meter last month
- `This month consumption` - the total consumption of this meter this month
- `This month cost` - the cost for the total consumption of this meter this month

Each meter also has two associated buttons. The `Download and Import History` button will fetch all data and import them as long-term statistics, allowing the meter to be imported into Home Assistant's Energy dashboard. The `Recalculate Statistics` button is mostly for fixing broken statistics, if any.
